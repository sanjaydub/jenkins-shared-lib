# Jenkins Pipeline Shared Library Sample

This project provides easy example of shared library which can be used into Jenkins pipeline.

1. In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure System. Under Global Pipeline Libraries, add a library with the following settings:
  * Library name: my-jenkins-shared-lib
  * Default version: Specify a Git reference (branch or commit SHA), e.g. master
  * Retrieval method: Modern SCM
  * Select the Git type
  * Project repository: 
  * Credentials: (leave blank)
  * You may have to turn off ssl verification using:     git.exe config --global http.sslVerify false

2. Then create a Jenkins job with the following pipeline (note that the underscore _ is not a typo):

```
@Library('my-jenkins-shared-lib')_

stage('Check Maven an Java') {
